title: The Playlist

Despite not posting last month, I have made some progress in my project to do
acoustic renditions of some of my favourite video game music!

Of note, I have finally installed Reaper, a DAW. While messing around, recording
and testing the software, I realized that a crucial missing piece of my music
vision was missing. I've mostly been focusing on the instrumentation of the
songs I want to play, but never really paying attention to the percussion!
Following this, I investigated some plug ins for Reaper that make adding a drum
track really easy electronically!

As for the music itself, I've compiled a short list of easy songs I want to turn
acoustic. These songs are intentionally really simple to give myself a soft
landing so to speak in this new world of recording, mixing, and mastering. Here
are the songs:

1. [Mario Kart 8: Animal Crossing
   Results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F54w-f-pBSc)
2. [Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney:
   Objection!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR4P8o95WPA)
3. [Animal Crossing New Horizons:
   5pm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtJIPu-Cns)

All of these songs are good starting places because they're slow in tempo, have
a limited number of lines, and for the most part have simple percussion grooves
(making it easy for me to recreate them in Reaper). Also, there are existing
transcriptions of these songs online, although at times the transcriptions are a bit
incomplete. Regardless, this will help me A LOT in that I won't have to
transcribe everything from scratch!

Next month I hope to:
1. Arrange *one* song from the above list for my instrumentation
2. Practice the parts
3. Record and see how it all comes together in a trial run

Thanks for reading and see you next year (haha...).
