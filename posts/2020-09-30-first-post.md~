title: My first post!

Hello!

This is my first post journaling my music Capstone project to complete my
degree at Concordia!

This post will be short and sweet, outline exactly what my project will
entail.

I plan to make *at least* 6 acoustic arrangements of video game music. On top of
the arrangements, I will record and publish my music on YouTube (and of course
post it here!).

My arrangements will showcase the instruments I currently own: piano, viola,
classical guitar, melodica, xylophone, and a bunch of small percussion
instruments (shakers, wood block, tambourine, so on).

My next blog posts will answer some existential questions about my project and
start the process of narrowing down the songs I want to play!

See you there :)
