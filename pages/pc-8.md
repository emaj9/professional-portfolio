####Evidence of development

My development of this competency can be seen in this whole website! Stage made
me realize how often I (and my colleagues) rely on technology so heavily for
teaching. It bothered me to know I rely so much on something but know so little
about it. Fortunately, an assignment for my seminar course asked me to create
an online portfoilo. I saw this as an opportunity to learn more about
technology and that's exactly what happened. Planning and creating this website
has been **a lot** of work, but now I understand so much more about computers.
I am enticed to learn more about teaching computer science now too.
