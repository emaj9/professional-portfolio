####Evidence of development

For me, this competency means helping students be caring individuals as care
is essential for future citizens to value. Care means respecting others and
building healthy relationships. On my last day, my students provided me with
gifts and cards; I believe these gestures, like gift giving and appreication,
are elements of a caring relationship. It takes two to create a positive
relationship and for care to be valued. In this way, I both demonstrated and
co-constructed healthy habits in relationships with my students.
