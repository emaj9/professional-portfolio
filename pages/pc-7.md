My development of this competency can be seen in the differentiation of the

Through collaboration with the resource teacher at my stage, I created the
following differentiated test for one of my students with an IEP in my class.
Given the high percentage of special needs students at my placement, I was
often working on differentiating my class material to meet the needs of all my
students. The difference between the test showcases how I collaborated with the
resource teacher to assess students with learning disabilities fairly.
