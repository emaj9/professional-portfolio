All my computer science lessons can be found on the webpage for the workshop I made
them for here:

<a href="https://www.computing-workshop.com"> Computing Workshop </a>
</div>

On this website is everything there is you need to know about Computing
Workshop, a workshop I co-created with my boyfriend, [Jake](https://www.jerrington.me).
This workshop was made possible by the support given by [Building
21](https://building21.ca).
