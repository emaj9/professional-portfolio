####Evidence of development

My development of this competency can be seen in this assessment for one of my
my geography classes:

In this assessment, you can see how my activity involves problem solving skills
and interactivity. This google form also synthesizes the data back to me so
that my assessment results representative the class's ability in general.

Another example of my development in PC 5 is my clarity with rubrics. Take for
example this rubric I gave to the same class:

Here, my assessment metrics are clearly labeled and defined for students to
easily understand. The metrics themselves are directly related to the class
content and requires creativity.
