####Evidence of development

My development of this competency can be seen on these lesson slides for one of
my geography classes:

Similar to my evidence from the PC 4, these slides demonstrate how I break down
my lesson content into smaller sized pieces for students to engage with.
Knowing that my students love socializing and have a hard time staying focused,
I structured my lesson so they were often broken up into small activities and
questions for students to solidify their learning through interacting with the
material. Students responded well to the instructions on the slides and enjoyed
being able to discuss their thoughts with other students.
