title: Teaching Philosophy
---

I prefer to teaching in democratic classroom environments where both students and teacher(s) are authentic members of
the class and learning community. This belief stems largely from Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy which doesn't see
students as empty vessels to be "educated" but rather that education is a transformative practice for those looking to
learn. In my teaching, I aim to foster a safe environment for students to develop themselves and their ideas, and by no
means claim to be the only source of knowledge. My preference is to learn along side my students, together.

I believe everyone has the right to education and am not blinded to the harm the education can do. Although education is
seen as the "great equalizer" it has the ability to punish the minority for not thinking like the majority. Consequently, my teaching aims to
eliminate this by fostering critical thinking over memorization and respecting and appreciating differences in the classroom.
