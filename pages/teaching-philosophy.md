title: Teaching Philosophy
---
I teach for 3 main reasons: I love to be around other people, I love to learn,
and teaching gets me connecting to my community, helping people on the
front lines.

Outside of loving to be around other people, which speaks for
itself, I find teaching a stimulating and enriching intellectual activity.
Thinking about lessons, activities to engage students, and how to best sequence
learning. What's more is teaching gets me learning subject matter as well as
how to translate certain complexities for those you're teaching. This makes
this field exciting and almost addicting.

Most importantly, teaching allows me to be on the ground helping people and
learning with them. The society we live in today is tough and problematic;
inequalities plague our society that privatizes profit but socializes costs.
I believe these inequalities such as race, gender, and wealth, have not been this
severe and pronounced for nearly 100 years. These issues are compounded by continue
abuse to the natural environment of our world. 

These realities while unnerving, they also demand for action to address these issues. Teaching provides a way to
confront these aspects of our society in an effective way. Fostering positive
relationships with students and creating a meaningful educational community
is one step in bringing down these exploitative
systems that have been institutionalize over long periods of time. These
systems will themselves be undone by generations of people looking to create a fairer and just world. 
While the arc towards moral justice is long, and will only bend
towards justice if we show the people of tomorrow how to learn and grow
themselves, support others, and create change in their communities.
