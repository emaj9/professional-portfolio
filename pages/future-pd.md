### The development doesn't stop there!

My professional development doesn't end with my program. For me, schooling isn't over as I plan to return to McGill to specialize my teaching practice. This is the main way I
will continue to develop my teaching competencies.

I'm returning to McGill to learn more about one of my passions, computer science, in hopes of becoming a computer
science teacher. This obviously points to how I will develop me knowledge and teaching practices. Along with my
continued schooling, I have already begun working with a McGill professor on computer science education reseach. My
research is focusing on how to incorporate Freirian style critical pedagogy into computer science education more
broadly. I hope to conduct this research by interviewing computer science teachers and review their teaching methods.

My ultimate goal is to get a master's in computer science, focusing my thesis on computer science education. As that is
rather far away, I'm not sure entirely what my path will look like but I know where I'm going. It goes without saying
that researching education, hearing about others experience and analyzing the imperical data on teaching styles will no
doubt develop my teaching practice. Whether it's planning lessons, evaluating student progress, working in communities
and with other teachers, my comptencies will continue to develop over the years! :)
