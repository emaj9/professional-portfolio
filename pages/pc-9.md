####Evidence of development

My development of this competency can be seen in the coding club
extra curriculur activity I hosted at my stage. You can see the slide about my coding club that was on school
announcements:

This club required that I cooperate with other staff to allow for my club to
exist. This meant communicating with the office to see the availabilities of a
certain and room and a computer cart, along with the cooperation of my
cooperating teachers. I collaborated with other tech-related extra curricular
activities related to coding as well.
