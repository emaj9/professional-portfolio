<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am Eric Mayhew, a newly certified
teacher from McGill. Everything here is made by me (unless otherwise specified) and free for non-commercial
use; please refer to the footer for more information about the licensing of my
material. The source code to <a href="https://www.github.com/emaj9/professional-portfolio">this website</a> and my other projects
are available on <a href="https://www.github.com/emaj9"> Github </a>. I chose to create my website myself by coding the
  HTML and CSS because I love the challenge and opportunity to learn new programming languages. Making this site has
  been a lot of fun! <p>
