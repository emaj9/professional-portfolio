<h3> My Interests </h3>

<h4>Music</h4>

I am a professional trained musician. I play piano in a variety of styles,
ranging from W.A. Mozart to Duke Ellington. Teaching musicianship, theory, and
performance have been a staple of my education career. I play second
instruments as well, such as guitar and viola. My most recent music interests
have taken the form of sound sythesis, in otherwords music made by computers
instead of traditional acoustic instruments. Picture on the right is my current
audio-digital music set up at home.


<h4>Computer Science</h4>

One of my biggest current pursuits is learning more about computer science and
specifically how to teach this content. Right now building this website has
fully captured my attention. On the right you can seem me planning out the core
funcations of my teaching portfoilo website.
