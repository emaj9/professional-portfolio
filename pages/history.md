title: History Lessons
---
On this page are my history lessons. Before using my lessons, it's important to
understand the focus of my lessons as they reflect my larger teaching style.
My lessons heavily focus on primary source analysis, in other words looking at
original documents and artefacts in my lessons. This allows me to meet my personal goal of providing my students with the opportunity to enhance their own analysis skills as well as help them create their own views about things in the past. That being said, teaching and interpreting these lessons
require a familiarity with historiography and historical thinking.
