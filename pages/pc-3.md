####Evidence of development

My development of this competency can be seen on these lesson slides for one of
my geography classes:

In my students work, I try to make it personal to them. As my class had a lot
of gamers and artists, I structure my lessons around allowing these students to
relate personally with the material. This is seen in asking my students to draw
certain maps or use images from Minecraft for students to relate to.
